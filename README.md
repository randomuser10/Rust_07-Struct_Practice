A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group.
Using struct, practiced how to calculate the length of a a rectangle, by creating a rectangle struct and passing it to a function where it takes reference of the struct 
and gives out the area of the rectangle
Also used Debug trait to display the values of a struct as we cannot display values of the struct by using simple println! as we can use for primitive types
